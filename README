This project is an attempt to "fill the holes" in the SML Basis library
and eventually build a "batteries included" modular suite of libraries
on top of that.  I know there are similar projects out there but they
all seem to either focus on a narrow area (like graph algorithms) or
they require a specific ML implementation (these days, mostly SMLNJ or
MLton).

I work with PolyML because it seems to be the implementation which is
closest to the original spirit of ML.  But if you detect any platform
dependency in the code please let me know, it is a bug.

All that said I will happily use pieces of the SMLNJ library (for
example) when it suits me.  Those pieces retain their original copyright
and license, of course.
